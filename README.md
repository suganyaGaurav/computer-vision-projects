# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains multiple computer vision projects implemented using
both Deep Learning and Classical Computer Vision techniques.

The projects are organized by paradigm to clearly demonstrate:
- Modern deep learning approaches
- Traditional rule-based computer vision methods

Each project is self-contained with its own code and documentation.
