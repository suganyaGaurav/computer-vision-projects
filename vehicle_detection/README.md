- Detect moving cars from a video stream
- Detect license plates from car images

## Approach
- Haar Cascade classifiers
- Classical computer vision techniques
- No deep learning models used

## Limitations
- Sensitive to lighting and camera angle
- Higher false positives compared to deep learning methods
- Works best in controlled environments

## Technologies Used
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
